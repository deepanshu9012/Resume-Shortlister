## 📖 Overview
The **AI Resume Shortlister** is an intelligent Applicant Tracking System (ATS) designed to automate the painful process of bulk resume screening. 

Instead of relying on rigid keyword matching (Ctrl+F), this tool leverages **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** and a **Smart Hybrid Search Architecture** to understand the *context* of a recruiter's query and accurately filter candidates based on experience, skills, and degrees.

## ✨ Key Features
* **🧠 Smart Hybrid Search:** Uses the LLM strictly as a translation layer to turn natural language queries (e.g., *"Python dev with 3+ years experience"*) into JSON rules. These rules are then enforced deterministically by Python (Pandas) to guarantee 100% accuracy and eliminate AI hallucinations.
* **📂 Multi-Format Ingestion:** Parses text from `.pdf` and `.docx` files natively. (Includes safe-mode OCR support for scanned images via `pytesseract`).
* **⚡ Incremental Processing:** Uses MD5 hashing to track processed files. It only analyzes *new* resumes added to the folder, drastically saving API costs and processing time.
* **📊 Structured Data Extraction:** Uses LangChain and Pydantic to force the LLM to output clean, reliable JSON data (Name, Experience, Skills, Degree).
* **🖥️ Interactive UI:** Built with Streamlit for a clean, user-friendly interface that lets recruiters view the database, execute searches, and securely open candidate resumes with one click.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **AI/Orchestration:** LangChain, Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Pydantic
* **File Parsing:** `pypdf`, `python-docx`, `pytesseract`, `Pillow`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
* Python 3.9 or higher.
* A free [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
* *(Optional)* [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) installed on your system if you want to scan image-based resumes.

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:


git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/deepanshu9012/Resume-Shortlister.git
cd Resume-Shortlister)

pip install streamlit pandas pypdf python-docx langchain-google-genai langchain-core pydantic Pillow pytesseract
### 3. Setup API Key
You need to provide your Gemini API key to the application. Open app.py and replace the placeholder in the config section, or set it securely in your terminal before running:

# On Windows
set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# On Mac/Linux
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
## 4. Running the App
Place a few test resumes (.pdf or .docx) into the resumes/ folder, then launch the Streamlit server:

streamlit run app.py

    └── processed_files.json # MD5 hash tracker to prevent reprocessing
🎯 How the Hybrid Search Works
When a user types a query like "Need a Java developer with 4 years of experience":

The Prompt: LangChain sends the query to Gemini.

The Translation: Gemini returns structured JSON: {"required_skills": ["java"], "min_experience": 4}.

The Execution: Pandas iterates through the CSV database and applies strict mathematical and string-matching filters based on the JSON criteria.

The Result: The UI displays only the perfect matches, avoiding the common LLM pitfall of "lazy searching" or skipping rows.
